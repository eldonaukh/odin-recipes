<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Broil chicken breasts for a simple but delicious way to prepare chicken.
  Extra-virgin olive oil and generous amounts of salt and pepper make for a
  savory chicken breast that is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>4 bone-in chicken breast halves with skin</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the
    oven's broiler. Rub olive oil over each chicken breast, then season both
    sides with salt and black pepper. Place the chicken skin-side down on a
    broiling pan.
  </li>
  <li>
    Broil in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then flip the chicken
    breast skin-side up. Continue broiling until no longer pink at the bone and
    the juices run clear, about 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer
    inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from
    the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
  </li>
</ol>
