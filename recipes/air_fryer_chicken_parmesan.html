<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 (8-ounce) boneless skinless chicken breasts, patted dry</li>
  <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
  <li>1/3 cup all purpose flour</li>
  <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
  <li>1 1/2 cups seasoned panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)</li>
  <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
  <li>1 cup jarred marinara sauce, plus more for serving</li>
  <li>1 cup shredded low-moisture, part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
  <li>
    On a cutting board, butterfly chicken by cutting each breast in half
    widthwise to create 4 thin pieces of chicken; season both sides with 1/2
    teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper.
  </li>
  <li>
    Place flour, egg, and panko in 3 separate shallow dishes. Add Parmesan, oil,
    crushed red pepper, and garlic powder to panko; stir to coat. Add remaining
    1/4 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper to flour; stir to
    combine. Working with 1 chicken piece at a time, dredge chicken in flour;
    shake off excess. Dip in egg; let excess drip off. Dredge in panko mixture
    to coat; place on a plate.
  </li>
  <li>
    Preheat a 6-quart air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 2 minutes.
    Working in two batches, add 2 chicken cutlets to the air fryer basket in a
    single layer. Cook until chicken is golden brown on both sides, about 5
    minutes per side.
  </li>
  <li>
    Top each chicken piece with 1/4 cup marinara and 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese.
  </li>
  <li>
    Snugly fit all 4 breasts in a single layer in air fryer basket; cook at 400
    degrees F (200 degrees C) until cheese is melted and browned and a
    thermometer inserted into the thickest portion of chicken registers 165
    degrees F (73 degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes.
  </li>
</ol>
